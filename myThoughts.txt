talking with the team

2 pointer solution
array (i) and another array (j)
iterative compare and push conditionally

set function
if you have an array, give it to the set function, it will return a new array with unique IDs


*results* obj ['key'] = value

iterate over the array each time pushing back to the results object

function isdue duedate submission duedate
using parse(submissiuion) due < parse(duedate)
if statement if they submit late?


BILL'S THOUGHTS

"i want to reformat the obj. learner submissions"
    go through the object
    find the same learner IDs
    for each learner ID, create new object->array
    fill respective data into each object


learner id w/ assignment id need to 

const assignmentgroup
const learner submissions

recognize different students, calculate scores, avg, etc.

creating 2 objects  in an array ?!?

went through learner array and asked to find each unique id and then inside an object placed the assignments in keys and then objects in those keys

with iterator he referenced the key of the object

used .find (the find function)




JAKI'S BUCKETS

course info
    id, name

assignment group
    id, name, course id, group weight, assignments

submission
    submitted at 
    score

assignments
    id
    name
    due at
    points possible

learner submissions
    learner id 
    assignment id 
    submission
