PROCESSING THE ASSIGNMENT 
-create function getLearnerData(CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]) to return an array of objects with requested info

NEED TO:
-make sure IDs ===
-find & sort 
-arithmetic
-filter dates
-fill new array w/ object1 and object2
-call by key
-deduct 10% for late assignment 
-


TESTING THE CODE
-Does the AssignmentGroup Course ID match the CourseInfo Course ID ? (Throw an Error)
-what if points possible is 0?
-what if num instead of string?

-Did you sort out assignments not yet due?
-Weighted avg, not avg for each


IMPORTANT ITEMS ON GRADING RUBRIC
-use at least 2  if/else statements
-use try/catch statements to manage potential errors
-at least 2 different types of loops
-at least one loop control: break or continue
-create arrays and objects
-retrieve/manipulate/remove items in an array or object
-use functions
-successful program output
-program runs without errors 
-commit frequently to Git Hub
-README File





TALKING WITH THE TEAM

LUKAS'S THOUGHTS

2 pointer solution
array (i) and another array (j)
iterative compare and push conditionally

set function
if you have an array, give it to the set function, it will return a new array with unique IDs


*results* obj ['key'] = value

iterate over the array each time pushing back to the results object

function isdue duedate submission duedate
using parse(submissiuion) due < parse(duedate)
if statement if they submit late?


BILL'S THOUGHTS

"i want to reformat the obj. learner submissions"
    go through the object
    find the same learner IDs
    for each learner ID, create new object->array
    fill respective data into each object


learner id w/ assignment id need to 

const assignmentgroup
const learner submissions

recognize different students, calculate scores, avg, etc.

creating 2 objects  in an array ?!?

went through learner array and asked to find each unique id and then inside an object placed the assignments in keys and then objects in those keys

with iterator he referenced the key of the object

used .find (the find function)




JAKI'S BUCKETS

course info
    id, name

assignment group
    id, name, course id, group weight, assignments

submission
    submitted at 
    score

assignments
    id
    name
    due at
    points possible

learner submissions
    learner id 
    assignment id 
    submission
