REFLECTION

What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

    -Well, I did what I'm not supposed to do, I know.  I started building before writing/planning it out, and that made some things more difficult than they probably needed to be.  Building a single function, single array, single object, works okay, but something tricky happens when trying to ge them to all work together. It gets easy to lose the thread.  I actually had to take out some of my requirements and start over with a simpler syntax.


Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

    -Removing particular values or elements was a challenge or conditional requests like the 10 percent point deduction.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

    -What would make all of these things easier is just more pratice, more time under my belt programming. It's all so fresh still. If given more time, I would just start over again.
